# Vem sa vad?

Private, **in-browser** audio &amp; video transcription that also tells you
**who said what**. The Whisper model runs entirely on the user's machine via
[Transformers.js](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js) (WebGPU, with
a WASM/CPU fallback). **Nothing is uploaded** and **nothing needs to be
installed** — just open the page.

Vem sa vad? is built on [Bjarbys Transcriber](https://github.com/fltman/bjarbys-transcriber)
by Anders Bjarby, and adds speaker separation and a few other features on top.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Three sources, one queue** — drop **multiple audio/video files**, record
  from the **microphone**, or search a **podcast** by name and pick episodes.
  Everything feeds a single queue that transcribes sequentially and (optionally)
  **auto-downloads** each transcript.
- 🇸🇪 **Swedish that actually works** — choose **KB-Whisper** (KBLab / National
  Library of Sweden) tiny → large, alongside standard multilingual and
  English-only Whisper models.
- 🎚️ **Pick your model & size** — every model offers quantization tiers with the
  real download size shown; backend-aware so you can't pick a broken combo.
- 🎬 **Audio _and_ video** — MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC and MP4 / MOV / WebM
  (the browser extracts the audio track).
- 📄 **Readable documents** (the default) — `.txt` or `.md`: one paragraph per
  speaker turn (a new one after a pause of 4 s or more), the speaker named
  once, a header with title, date, length and speakers, and optional `[mm:ss]`
  timestamps.
- 📝 **More formats** — `.srt` and `.vtt` subtitles, `.json` (with
  timestamps), and **Lines** (`.lines.txt`, one Whisper fragment per line, for
  scripts). Tick as many as you like; the audio is only analysed once and every
  format is rendered from that same result. Several are saved as one `.zip`.
- 🗣️ **Speaker separation** (optional, experimental) — labels each line
  `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2`, … via
  [pyannote](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0), and lets you
  **name the speakers** ("Anna", "Erik") in the transcript view; the names
  carry into Copy and every download. Off by default; see
  [the caveats](#speaker-separation) before relying on it.
- 🔒 **Private by design** — transcription is 100% local; models download once
  from the Hugging Face CDN and cache in your browser.
- 💾 **Pick up where you left off — if you choose to** — your settings are
  remembered, and you can **opt in** to keeping finished transcripts (with
  speaker names and corrections) in this browser across reloads. It's off by
  default: when your first transcript finishes, the app asks, and explains
  that kept transcripts **stay until you delete them** (✕ on each, or *Delete
  all finished*) and that anyone using the browser could open them. Change it
  any time in Settings; turning it off deletes the saved copies. The original
  audio is never kept, so restored transcripts can be edited and exported but
  not played back.

## Run it yourself

Vem sa vad? is a fork of [fltman/bjarbys-transcriber](https://github.com/fltman/bjarbys-transcriber)
that adds [speaker separation](#speaker-separation). Everything runs locally —
there is no server to set up.

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20.19+ or 22.12+ and git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/promptagency/vem-sa-vad.git
cd vem-sa-vad
npm install
npm run dev      # open http://localhost:5173
```

- **Use a browser with WebGPU** (Chrome or Edge are the safe choice) for
  speed: the models then run on the GPU. Without WebGPU the app falls back to
  the CPU, which works but is much slower.
- **The first transcription downloads the model** (about 110 MB for the
  default, KB-Whisper Base, on a GPU; about 180 MB on CPU) from Hugging Face. The browser caches it, so later runs
  start straight away.
- **Podcasts work in `npm run dev`:** the dev server includes a stand-in for
  `proxy.php` (see [below](#podcasts--proxyphp)). `npm run preview` doesn't
  include it, so use `dev` locally.
- `localhost` counts as a secure origin, so the microphone and WebGPU work
  without HTTPS.

To serve it for others instead, see the next section.

## Build & deploy to a LAMP server

```bash
npm run build    # outputs static files to dist/
```

Copy the **contents of `dist/`** into your Apache web root (or a subfolder).
A ready-to-use **`.htaccess`** and the podcast **`proxy.php`** are included in
`public/` and are emitted into `dist/` by the build.

- **HTTPS is required** for the microphone (`getUserMedia`) and WebGPU. The
  `.htaccess` force-redirects to HTTPS (localhost is exempt).
- **No COOP/COEP headers needed** for WebGPU or single-threaded WASM — they're
  left commented out in `.htaccess`.
- **Serving from a subfolder** needs no rebuild: the build uses relative paths
  (`base: './'` in `vite.config.ts`). If Apache's fallback misbehaves there,
  add a `RewriteBase` to `.htaccess`.

### Podcasts &amp; `proxy.php`

Searching uses Apple's iTunes API (CORS-enabled, direct). Most podcast hosts,
however, block cross-origin reads of their RSS/audio, so the app first tries a
**direct fetch** and falls back to a **same-origin proxy** — `proxy.php` — which
your own server fetches through. This keeps it private to your server (no
third-party CORS proxy). `proxy.php` needs PHP with cURL and includes basic
SSRF protection; harden it (e.g. a host allow-list) before public exposure. If
you don't deploy `proxy.php`, file and microphone transcription still work, and
podcasts work for any host that happens to send CORS headers.

## Models

| Group | Models | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Swedish — KB-Whisper** | tiny · base · small · medium · large | Best Swedish accuracy. `large`/`medium` are big — use WebGPU. |
| **Multilingual — Whisper** | tiny · base · small · large-v3-turbo | ~100 languages, detected automatically from the first 30 s (shown as "Detected language"). Turbo is the fast flagship (WebGPU). |
| **English — Whisper** | tiny · base · small (`.en`) | Slightly better on English. |

Quantization: **Balanced (GPU)** is the default on **WebGPU** — a 16-bit encoder
with a 4-bit decoder, about half the download of full precision with the same
accuracy in our tests (GPUs without 16-bit support get a 32-bit encoder instead).
**8-bit (q8)** is the default on **CPU/WASM** (an 8-bit *decoder* is ~10× slower
on WebGPU, so it's offered only on CPU); **full (fp32)** is available for the
smaller models. The measurements behind these choices are in
[`docs/webgpu-quantization.md`](docs/webgpu-quantization.md).

### Speaker separation

Ticking **Separate speakers** additionally loads
[`onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0`](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0)
— an ONNX build of [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0),
about 1.5 MB, MIT. It runs on WASM alongside Whisper and needs no extra
dependency. Each chunk in the `.json` export then carries `speaker` and
`speaker_conf`, and the other formats prefix each line with `Speaker N:`.

Open a finished transcript to **name the speakers**: one field per detected
speaker, applied immediately to the transcript, Copy and downloads. Names are
per transcript, since "Speaker 1" is a different person in every recording.
In the documents, `.srt`/`.vtt` and Lines the name replaces `Speaker N`; in `.json` the chunks
keep their numeric `speaker` and a top-level `speakers` object maps each
number to its name. An automatic download happens before you've named
anyone, so download again after naming.

The open transcript is also a **review view** for checking and correcting it
line by line:

- **▶ plays that line** from the original file, stopping at its end.
- **Unsure lines are highlighted** in amber — where the model's margin between
  the top two speakers is low, or it found no speaker — and *Only unsure
  lines* filters to them. In testing, these were the lines where two voices
  overlapped.
- **Change a line's speaker** (including *New speaker* or *No speaker*) or
  **click its text to edit it**. Enter or clicking elsewhere saves, Esc
  cancels; text is kept on one line so subtitle cues stay valid.
- **Revert** undoes your changes to a line.

Corrections flow into Copy and every export; corrected chunks carry
`"edited": true` in `.json`, and a speaker you set has `speaker_conf` 1 (0 for
*No speaker*). If you've opted in to keeping transcripts, edits and names are
kept with them across reloads.

**Measured accuracy: 94.7%** of words attributed to the correct speaker, on a
hand-labelled 12-minute two-person Swedish interview (231 utterances, 2116
words). Lines where no speaker was detected count as wrong. Reproduce with `scripts/eval-diarization.mjs` — see
[Evaluating speaker separation](#evaluating-speaker-separation).

That figure is for a clean recording of two people. Known limits:

- **At most 3 speakers.** The model reports speaker activity as a *powerset*
  over three local speakers, so a fourth voice cannot be represented at all.
- **Long recordings are stitched, not seamless.** A single pass eventually
  exhausts the browser's WASM memory, so audio is diarized in windows that
  overlap by two minutes, and speakers are matched across each seam by who is
  talking at the same moments. How much fits in one pass depends on the device
  and on how much the chosen Whisper model has already claimed, so the window
  starts at 25 minutes and halves on retry if a pass runs out of memory. A 67-minute two-person interview comes
  out as 2 speakers. But someone who stays silent through an entire overlap
  cannot be matched and is given a fresh label rather than a guessed one, so
  very long or very lopsided recordings may still show extra speakers.
- **Short interjections are the main error.** Half of the wrong words sit in
  utterances under 1.5 s — typically a backchannel ("Just det.") spoken over
  someone still talking. A chunk's audio is dominated by the other speaker
  even though the transcribed words are the interjector's, so time-weighted
  attribution gets it wrong, sometimes confidently. See
  [Why not word-level timestamps?](#why-not-word-level-timestamps) — the
  obvious fix was measured and makes attribution worse, not better.
- **`speaker_conf`** is the margin between the top two speakers' talk time
  within a chunk. Low values mean overlapping speech rather than a wrong
  answer; `speaker` is `null` where no speech was detected at all. About half
  the errors above are already flagged this way.

### Why not word-level timestamps?

The natural fix for the interjection errors above looks like attributing
*words* rather than phrase chunks: `return_timestamps: 'word'` gives spans
around 0.2 s against ~2 s for phrase chunks, easily fine enough to isolate a
half-second "Just det." It was tried, measured, and **it makes attribution
worse.**

Transcribing the fixture twice with the same model and diarizing both, so
granularity is the only variable (`scripts/eval-word-timestamps.mjs`):

| attribution | units | median span | word accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| phrase-level (what ships) | 288 | 1.94 s | **98.4%** |
| word-level | 1996 | 0.20 s | 94.7% (−3.7 pp) |
| words regrouped into sentences | 201 | 2.80 s | 97.7% (−0.7 pp) |

The padding really does cause the interjection errors — but it also does
useful work everywhere else. A two-second span covers roughly 120 diarization
frames and averages out noise; a 0.2 s word covers about 12 and can land
entirely on a glitch. Removing the padding loses more than it recovers, so
phrase-sized units are the right granularity and the errors above are the
price of it.

(Those percentages are not comparable to the 94.7% quoted earlier: this
experiment uses a different ASR model and scores against time intervals rather
than per labelled utterance. Only the three rows are comparable to each other.)

The availability problem below is therefore moot — but it is recorded because
it took a while to establish, and "just use word timestamps" is an obvious
thing to suggest.

Word timestamps are derived from the decoder's **cross-attentions**, and the
ONNX models this app loads are not exported with them:

```
Model outputs must contain cross attentions to extract timestamps.
This is most likely because the model was not exported with `output_attentions=True`.
```

Having `alignment_heads` in `generation_config.json` is not sufficient — every
model here declares it and still fails. What the export needs is the
cross-attentions themselves, and each candidate was checked:

| build | word timestamps |
|---|---|
| `KBLab/kb-whisper-*` | ✗ no cross-attentions |
| `onnx-community/kb-whisper-*-ONNX` | ✗ no cross-attentions |
| `pappa1337/kb-whisper-{tiny,small}-onnx-words` | ✗ won't load — transformers.js reports `Unsupported model type: whisper` |
| `onnx-community/whisper-*_timestamped` (13 of them) | ✓ works, verified |

So the blocker is specific: **no working KB-Whisper build exposes
cross-attentions.** The `_timestamped` variants that do work include
multilingual ones, and those *can* transcribe Swedish — this is a real option,
not an impossibility. It just means giving up KB-Whisper's Swedish accuracy for
generic Whisper, plus re-downloading a different model. Whether better speaker
attribution outweighs worse transcription has not been measured.

Exporting KB-Whisper with `output_attentions=True` would remove that
obstacle — but the measurement above says it would not be worth doing, since
finer spans attribute worse. `speaker_conf` already flags roughly half of these
errors, and that remains the sensible mitigation.

### Evaluating speaker separation

`scripts/eval-diarization.mjs` scores the shipping code against a hand-labelled
fixture, so changes to diarization can be measured instead of eyeballed.

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/eval-diarization.mjs <fixture-dir> [windowMinutes]
```

The fixture lives outside the repo — real recordings are usually confidential —
and the directory needs two files:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `labels.csv` | `idx;time_in_clip;speaker;text;dur_s;rel_start;rel_end;…`, one row per utterance, `speaker` hand-filled (`,` or `;` separated) |
| `excerpt.wav` | the same audio, 16 kHz mono |

It reports word-level accuracy, the number of distinct speakers, speaker changes
landing on a window boundary, and duplicated spans. Pass `windowMinutes` to force
the windowed path on a short clip — handy for exercising boundary behaviour
without labelling hours of audio.

## How it works

`src/worker.ts` runs the Transformers.js ASR pipeline in a Web Worker. Audio is
decoded to mono 16 kHz PCM on the main thread (`src/lib/audio.ts`) and
transferred to the worker. Long audio is chunked (`chunk_length_s: 30`) with a
2.5 s overlap on each side — the library's default of 5 s repeated whole
sentences at the seams (see `docs/benchmark.md`). See `src/lib/models.ts` for the model catalog.

Progress comes from a `WhisperTextStreamer`: its chunk callbacks report
timestamps within Whisper's current 30 s window, and the worker reconstructs a
whole-file position from them.

With speaker separation on, the worker runs the pyannote model over the same
PCM and decodes its powerset output into per-speaker activity spans — silence
and simultaneous speech are *not* speakers, which is easy to get wrong.
`src/lib/diarize.ts` then attributes each Whisper chunk to whoever holds the
floor longest across it, and merges away brief low-confidence blips.
